# Microbusiness Density Prediction Model

## Overview
This project involves a machine learning model designed to predict the density of microbusinesses in various geographic regions based on a set of features. The model leverages Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while capturing the most significant variance in the data. This repository contains the necessary files and instructions to run the model demonstration through a Streamlit web application.

## Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to provide stakeholders and interested parties with insights into factors influencing microbusiness densities, thereby aiding in decision-making processes related to economic development, urban planning, and resource allocation.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Incorporation of PCA for effective dimensionality reduction.
- **Interactive Demo**: A Streamlit-based web interface allowing users to input features and receive predictions in real-time.
- **Model Transparency**: Explanation of how PCA affects feature selection and impacts the model's predictions.
